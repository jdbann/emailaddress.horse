I've spent the last couple of days watching most of the videos put out by [Brick
Technology] on YouTube. Sadly it is not quite as many as I would like.

It's just long videos of engineering challenges and a cycle of building, testing
and improving. A particular highlight would be this one demonstrating the
construction of a 5-speed manual gearbox:
