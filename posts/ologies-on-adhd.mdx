I didn't know the podcast before this, but
[Ologies](https://www.alieward.com/#podcaststuff) recently put out two episodes
about ADHD:

- [Part 1: Attention-Deficit Neuropsychology (ADHD) with Russell
  Barkley](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/adhd)
- [Part 2: Attention-Deficit Neuropsychology (ADHD) with How to ADHD, Black Girl
  Lost Keys, Jahla Osborne + more](https://www.alieward.com/ologies/adhd2)

I've had a few people talk to me lately about their personal ADHD suspicions, or
early stages of seeking a diagnosis. I think these will be my default
recommendations for quite a while.

The first episode is the ultimate primer for 'what all this ADHD thing really
is', and the second episode is about the emotional, social, and cultural world
of it.
