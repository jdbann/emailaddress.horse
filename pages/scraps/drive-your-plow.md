Murders, Blake translations, gloomy Polish forests, horoscopes,
environmentalism. It's got everything you could want.

Great "subversive, entertaining noir novel" from [Nobel Prize in
Literature][Flights - Nobel Prize] winning author [Olga Tokarczuk][Olga
Tokarczuk - Culture.pl] and a skilled translation from Antonia Lloyd-Jones.

I had strong vibes of Tehanu, the fourth of [the Earthsea series][Earthsea -
Bookshop.org], and I wouldnâ€™t be against an ITV adaptation with Brenda Blethyn.
It would be a travesty, but I would watch it.

For RPG people, it nods at the hearth fantasy I hope [Stonetop][Stonetop -
Kickstarter] could provide whilst sticking to a contemporary Poland. And
Tokarczuk expresses the protagonist's point-of-view in a way you can't help but
extrapolate her life beyond the closing chapter - bringing this ability to a
journaling game like [Thousand Year Old Vampire] is my dream.
