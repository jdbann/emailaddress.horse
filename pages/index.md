Hi! I'm John Bannister. Or [@jdbannister] if you're a Twitter person.

I'm a web developer, currently working at [Bookshop.org].

Right now I'm finishing off work on [Ex Libris RPG] - a database of indie RPG
content, funded by the community in a [Kickstarter campaign][Ex Libris
Kickstarter] last year.
